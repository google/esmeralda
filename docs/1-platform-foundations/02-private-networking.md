# Stage 2: Private Networking, DNS & PSC

### A. Network Architecture & Topology Guide

Stage 2 implements Zero-Trust network infrastructure to ensure that no API or AI agent communicates over public internet channels.

### A. VPC Subnet Topology (`gateway-vpc`)
In the `prj-net-host` project, we allocate the following CIDR ranges:
*   **Core Workload Subnet (`gke-subnet`)**: `10.0.0.0/20` for internal compute runtimes and test VMs.
*   **Regional Envoy Proxy Subnet (`gateway-proxy-subnet`)**: `10.9.0.0/24` dedicated exclusively to Envoy-based internal Application Load Balancers (ILB).
*   **PSC NAT Subnet (`gateway-psc-subnet`)**: `10.10.0.0/24` for outbound Private Service Connect connections.
*   **PSC Interface Subnet (`psc-interface-subnet`)**: `10.11.0.0/28` providing local private endpoints for Vertex AI Reasoning Engines operating within Google-managed VPCs.

### B. Private DNS and Gateway Static Routing
To decouple dynamic Vertex AI service URLs, we establish a private Cloud DNS zone named `internal.gateway.` pointing all tool and agent routes to the internal IP (`10.0.0.5`) of the Internal Load Balancer (ILB):
*   `email.internal.gateway` -> `10.0.0.5`
*   `income-verification.internal.gateway` -> `10.0.0.5`
*   `dms.internal.gateway` -> `10.0.0.5`

# Stage 2: Shared VPC Host Networking & Secure Egress

This module handles core network topologies including private IP address allocation, Shared VPC, Cloud NAT gateway egress, Secure Web Proxy (SWP) whitelist policies, and Private Service Connect (PSC).

### 7.2 Stage 2: `modules/2-networking/` Specification

This module establishes the Shared VPC network, configures the internal subnet routing topologies, sets up Private Service Connect (PSC) Network Attachments, deploys Google Cloud's Secure Web Proxy (SWP) for audited internet egress, and handles corporate DNS zones. It is designed to run on the Shared VPC Host Project (`prj-net-host`), but can be toggled to a pure-attachment mode for pre-existing (brownfield) customer networks.

#### A. Network Subnet and Routing Architecture
In Greenfield mode, the module provisions a comprehensive hub network with dedicated subnets for core workloads, proxy-only routing, PSC endpoints, serverless integration, and database peering:

            SubnetPSC_I["PSC Interface Subnet<br/>(sb-esmeralda-psc-interface)<br/>10.11.0.0/28"]
            PSA["Private Services Access Range<br/>(sql-peering-range)<br/>10.130.0.0/16"]
        end
        Router["Cloud Router"]
        NAT["Cloud NAT (External Outbound)"]
        SWP["Secure Web Proxy (SWP)<br/>Explicit Gateway Filter<br/>10.0.1.100"]
    end

    Router --> NAT
    SubnetCore --> SWP
    SWP --> Router
    PSA -. Internal Peering .-> DB["Private Cloud SQL<br/>(Database Project)"]
```

##### 1. Subnet Classifications
*   **Core Backend Subnet (`sb-esmeralda-core`)**: Host IP range `10.0.1.0/24`. All primary internal workloads (Cloud Run instances, VPC connectors, and private VMs) operate inside this range. Private Google Access is enabled to permit calling Vertex AI and Secret Manager without traversing the public internet.
*   **Regional Envoy Proxy Subnet (`sb-esmeralda-proxy`)**: Host IP range `10.9.0.0/24`. Required by regional internal Application Load Balancers or secure regional gateways (Apigee or Kong). Configured with purpose `REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY` and role `ACTIVE`.
*   **PSC Endpoint Subnet (`sb-esmeralda-psc`)**: Host IP range `10.10.0.0/24` reserved for private Google services PSC endpoints.
*   **PSC Interface Subnet (`sb-esmeralda-psc-interface`)**: Host IP range `10.11.0.0/28`. A highly specific regular subnet utilized solely to bind Google-managed Serverless runtimes.
*   **Private Services Access (`sql-peering-range`)**: Allocated block `10.130.0.0/16` reserved for Serverless Cloud SQL Private Services peering connections.

#### B. Serverless Bridges: Private Service Connect (PSC) Network Attachment
Because Vertex AI Reasoning Engines and serverless Cloud Run agents reside natively in Google-managed tenant projects, they do not have direct access to resources inside custom customer VPCs. Esmeralda bridges this boundary using a **PSC Network Attachment**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Agent as Vertex AI Reasoning Engine / Cloud Run Agent
    participant Attachment as PSC Network Attachment<br/>(sb-esmeralda-psc-interface)
    participant VPC as Shared VPC Network<br/>(sb-esmeralda-core)
    participant DB as Private Cloud SQL

    Agent->>Attachment: 1. Initiates PSC Interface Connection
    Attachment->>VPC: 2. Bridges traffic privately into VPC via PSC-I subnet
    VPC->>DB: 3. Connects to database over private IP (VPC Peering)
```

1.  **Subnet Isolation**: A dedicated regular subnetwork (`sb-esmeralda-psc-interface`) is configured.
2.  **Compute Network Attachment**: The resource `google_compute_network_attachment` references the PSC-I subnet and is set to `ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC`. This creates a PSC interface point. Serverless agents use this resource link to establish incoming tunnels directly into the VPC.
3.  **Firewall Protection**: Ingress firewalls are restricted to only allow ports `22` (SSH for debugging), `443` (HTTPS for APIs), and `ICMP` originating from the PSC Interface subnet (`10.11.0.0/28`).

---

#### C. Egress Auditing & Filtering: Secure Web Proxy (SWP)
To comply with enterprise security requirements, reasoning engines and corporate AI agents are not permitted to establish arbitrary connections to the public internet. Stage 2 provisions a **Secure Web Proxy (SWP)** to audit and control egress traffic:
*   **The SWP Instance**: Deployed via GCP's `google_network_security_gateway_security_policy` (or Fabric's `net-swp` module) in the workloads subnet with a static internal IP (`10.0.1.100`).
*   **Egress Interception**: Workloads communicating via the PSC Interface are configured with an explicit proxy pointing to `10.0.1.100:443`.
*   **Access Rules**: Configured with strict session matching and rules (e.g., matching corporate whitelisted LLMs and SaaS tools while blocking unauthorized domains, with error logging activated).

---

#### D. Shared VPC Attachments & Network User IAM Bindings
To allow the separate workload projects to send private traffic across the Shared VPC, they must be attached as service projects, and their respective service agents must be granted subnet execution rights:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Host["prj-net-host<br/>Shared VPC Host"]
    Subnet["sb-esmeralda-core Subnet"]

    Host -. Service Project Attachment .-> P_MCP["prj-esmeralda-mcps"]
    Host -. Service Project Attachment .-> P_A2A["prj-esmeralda-a2a-agents"]
    Host -. Service Project Attachment .-> P_Root["prj-esmeralda-root-agent"]

    SA_MCP["Cloud Run Service Agent (mcps)"] -->|roles/compute.networkUser| Subnet
    SA_A2A["Cloud Run Service Agent (a2a)"] -->|roles/compute.networkUser| Subnet
    SA_Root["Vertex AI Service Agent (root)"] -->|roles/compute.networkUser| Subnet
```

For workloads in service projects to bind VPC Connectors or establish PSC attachments in the host subnet, the host project must authorize the following service agents with the `roles/compute.networkUser` role on the specific subnet:
1.  **Google APIs Service Agent**: `service-[PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com` (Handles backend resources orchestration).
2.  **Serverless VPC Access Robot**: `service-[PROJECT_NUMBER]@serverless-robot-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Enables Serverless VPC Access Connectors).
3.  **Vertex AI Agent**: `service-[PROJECT_NUMBER]@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Allows Direct VPC egress for Vertex AI Reasoning Engines).

---

#### E. DNS Service Discovery Layout
To facilitate service discovery, Stage 2 deploys two central private DNS zones visible inside the Shared VPC:
1.  **`esmeralda.internal` Zone**: Used for internal service-to-service discovery (e.g., `dms.esmeralda.internal`, `calculator.esmeralda.internal`).
2.  **`internal.gateway` Zone**: Used to peering PSC interfaces. Contains:
    *   Wildcard record `*.internal.gateway.` resolving to the Internal Load Balancer VIP.
    *   Static record `swp.internal.gateway.` resolving to the Secure Web Proxy IP (`10.0.1.100`).

---

#### F. Greenfield vs. Brownfield (BYO) Logic
When `byo_networking = true` is supplied:
*   We **bypass** creating the VPC, subnetworks (core, proxy, psc, psc-interface), Cloud Router, NAT, and the service networking connection.
*   We **still execute** Shared VPC Host Project enablement, Service Project Attachments, Subnet IAM bindings, and DNS Zones, hooking the three new service projects directly into the customer's pre-configured Shared VPC and SWP infrastructure.
